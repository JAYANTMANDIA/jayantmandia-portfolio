Jayant Mandia — BTech Software Engineering student at SRM University | Passionate about Web Development, Java, and building impactful projects.


I developed a modern, fully responsive personal portfolio website to establish a strong professional online presence and effectively showcase my technical skills, projects, and development journey as a Software Engineering student at SRM University.

The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance optimization, and user experience. I implemented smooth scroll-based animations, interactive UI components, and responsive layouts to ensure seamless performance across all devices and screen sizes.

The website highlights my key projects, technical skills, and practical experience, enabling recruiters and collaborators to quickly understand my capabilities and areas of expertise. I structured the codebase to maintain readability, scalability, and maintainability, following best practices in frontend development.

Special emphasis was placed on UI/UX design principles, including visual hierarchy, modern typography, spacing consistency, and intuitive navigation. Additionally, the portfolio is optimized for fast loading speeds and smooth performance, demonstrating my understanding of web optimization techniques.

This project reflects not only my technical proficiency but also my attention to detail, problem-solving mindset, and commitment to continuous improvement. It serves as a dynamic representation of my growth as a developer and my readiness to contribute effectively in real-world development environments.
